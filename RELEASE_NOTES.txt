Release 5.0
------------------

This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpCore 5.0.

Notable changes and features included in the 5.0 series:

* Support for HTTP/2 protocol and conformance to requirements and recommendations
  of the latest HTTP/2 protocol specification (RFC 7540, RFC 7541)

  Supported features:

    ** HPACK header compression
    ** stream multiplexing (client and server)
    ** flow control
    ** response push (client and server)
    ** message trailers
    ** expect-continue handshake
    ** connection validation (ping)
    ** application-layer protocol negotiation (ALPN) on Java 9+
    ** TLS 1.2 security features

   Features out of scope for 5.0 release:

    ** padding of outgoing frames
    ** stream priority
    ** plain connection HTTP/1.1 upgrade
    ** CONNECT method

* Improved conformance to requirements and recommendations of the latest HTTP/1.1 protocol
  specification (RFC 7230, RFC 7231)

* New asynchronous HTTP transport APIs consistent for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 transport.

* Redesigned I/O reactor APIs and improved NIO based reactor implementation for a greater
  performance and scalability.

* Support for server-side request filters for classic and asynchronous server implementations.
  Request filters could be used to implement cross-cutting protocol aspects such
  as the 'expect-continue' handshaking and user authentication / authorization.

* Support for Reactive Streams API [http://www.reactive-streams.org/]

* Redesigned connection pool implementation with strict connection limit guarantees.
  The connection pool is expected to have a better performance under higher concurrency
  due to reduced global pool lock contention.

* New connection pool implementation with lax connection limit guarantees and better
  performance under higher concurrency due to absence of a global pool lock.

* Package name space changed to 'org.apache.hc.core5'

* Maven group id changed to 'org.apache.httpcomponents.core5'

HttpCore 5.0 releases can be co-located with earlier versions.

adds several incremental improvements.

Notable changes and features included in the 5.0 series:

* Support for HTTP/2 protocol and conformance to requirements and recommendations
  of the latest HTTP/2 protocol specification (RFC 7540, RFC 7541)

  Supported features:

    ** HPACK header compression
    ** stream multiplexing (client and server)
    ** flow control
    ** response push (client and server)
    ** message trailers
    ** expect-continue handshake
    ** connection validation (ping)
    ** application-layer protocol negotiation (ALPN) on Java 9+

Release 4.3-BETA1
-------------------

This is the first BETA release from the 4.3.x release branch. The main theme of the 4.3 release
series is streamlining of component configuration and deprecation of the old configuration
API based on HttpParams in favor of constructor-based dependency injection and plain objects
for configuration parameters.

This release also includes performance optimizations intended to reduce TCP packet fragmentation
when writing out HTTP messages both in blocking and non-blocking I/O modes, which should result
in up to 20% higher throughput for short entity enclosing messages.

  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-319] Non-blocking SSLIOSession can fail to shut down correctly when the underlying
  connection gets terminated abnormally by the opposite endpoint in case there is a truncated or
  corrupted encrypted content in the input buffer and there is still data in the output buffer
  that needs to be flushed out (most likely to occur with POST or PUT requests).
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>



Release 4.3-ALPHA1
-------------------

This is the first release from the 4.3.x release branch. The main focus of the 4.3 release
series is streamlining of component configuration and deprecation of the old configuration
API based on HttpParams in favor of constructor based dependency injection and plain objects
for configuration parameters.

-------------------

This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpCore 4.2. The most notable features included in this
release are connection pool components for blocking and non-blocking HTTP connections and new
asynchronous client and server-side protocol handlers.

New protocol handling API used in conjunction with connection pooling components is expected to
make development of asynchronous HTTP client agents and HTTP proxies easier and less error prone.

Connection pool components are based on mature code migrated from HttpClient and HttpAsyncClient
modules but have a slightly different API that makes a better use of Java standard concurrent
primitives.

and rewritten asynchronous protocol handlers. New protocol handling API used in conjunction with
connection pooling components is expected to make development of asynchronous HTTP client agents
and HTTP proxies easier and less error prone.

Sample application shipped with the release include an example of an HTTP file server capable of
direct channel (zero copy) data transfer and an example of a non-blocking, fully streaming reverse
proxy.

This release also incorporates bug fixes from the stable 4.1.x branch and includes an updated
HttpCore tutorial.



Release 4.1.4
-------------------

This is a maintenance release that fixes a number of bugs found since 4.1.3. It is also likely
to be the last release in the 4.1.x branch.

Change Log
-------------------

* [HTTPCORE-286] Canceled I/O session can cause an IllegalStateException in BaseIOReactor#validate
  leading to an abnormal termination of the I/O reactor.

* [HTTPCORE-268] Handle runtime exceptions thrown by SSLEngine.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>



Release 4.2-ALPHA2
-------------------

This is the second ALPHA release of HttpCore 4.2. This release comes with completely redesigned
and rewritten asynchronous protocol handlers. New protocol handling API used in conjunction with
connection pooling components introduced in the previous ALPHA release is expected to make
development of asynchronous HTTP client agents and HTTP proxies easier and less error prone.

Sample application shipped with the release include an example of an HTTP file server capable of
direct channel (zero copy) data transfer and an example of a non-blocking, fully streaming reverse
proxy.

We are kindly asking existing and prospective users of HttpCore to review and try out the
new protocol handlers and give us feedback while the 4.2 API is still not final. If no major flaws
are discovered the 4.2 API is expected to be frozen with the next BETA release.

Please note that new features included in this release are still considered experimental and
their API may change in the future ALPHA releases. This release also marks the end of support for
Java 1.3. As of this release HttpCore requires Java 1.5 for all its components. Several classes and
methods deprecated between versions 4.0-beta1 and 4.0 GA (more than two years ago) have been
removed in this release.

Change Log
-------------------

* [HTTPCORE-270] Fixed IllegalStateException in AbstractSessionOutputBuffer and
  AbstractSessionInputBuffer.
  Contributed by William R. Speirs <bill.speirs at gmail.com>

  route has been exceeded and all connections in the route pool are stateful.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>


Release 4.2-ALPHA1
-------------------

This is the first ALPHA release of 4.2. The most notable feature included in this release is
support for connection pools of blocking and non-blocking HTTP connections. Connection pool
components are based on mature code migrated from HttpClient and HttpAsyncClient modules but have
a slightly different API that makes a better use of Java standard concurrent primitives.

Support for connection pools in HttpCore is expected to make development of client and proxy HTTP
services easier and less error prone.

Please note that new features included in this release are still considered experimental and
their API may change in the future ALPHA releases. This release also marks the end of support for
Java 1.3. As of this release HttpCore requires Java 1.5 for all its components. Several classes and
methods deprecated between versions 4.0-beta1 and 4.0 GA (more than two years ago) have been
removed in this release.

  without sending a 'close notify' message causing an infinite loop in the I/O dispatch thread.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

Release 4.1.2
-------------------

This is a patch release that fixes a number of bugs found in the previous version.

Please note that several classes and methods deprecated between versions 4.0-beta1 and 4.0 GA
(more than two years ago) will also be removed in the 4.2 branch.

Release 4.0
-------------------

This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpCore 4.0. This release mainly improves the
documentation and fixes a few minor bugs reported since the previous release. HttpCore
now comes with a complete tutorial presenting an in-depth coverage of the API.

HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used to build custom
client and server-side HTTP services with a minimal footprint. HttpCore supports two I/O
models: blocking I/O model based on the classic Java I/O and non-blocking, event driven I/O
model based on Java NIO.  The blocking I/O model may be more appropriate for data intensive,
low latency scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more appropriate for high latency
scenarios where raw data throughput is less important than the ability to handle thousands of
simultaneous HTTP connections in a resource efficient manner.

* [HTTPCORE-180] Fixed NPE in standard I/O event dispatchers when
  IOEventDispatch#disconnected fires before the session was fully initialized
  (IOEventDispatch#connected was not called).
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-175] Chunk decoders no longer accept truncated chunks as valid input.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>


Release 4.0 Beta 3
-------------------

The third BETA version of HttpComponents Core has been released. This is a
maintenance release, which addresses a number of issues discovered since the
previous release.

  exceptional termination of the underlying connection.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-170] Fixed race condition in SharedOutputBuffer.
  Contributed by Jason Walton <Jason.Walton at alcatel-lucent.com>
