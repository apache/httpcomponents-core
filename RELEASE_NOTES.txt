Release 4.0 Alpha 1
-------------------

This release represents a complete redesign of the Jakarta Commons HttpClient
3.x API and a significant rewrite of the core HTTP components derived from 
HttpClient 3.0 code base.

These components will form the foundation of the future releases of Jakarta
HttpClient and can also be used separately to build custom client- and 
server-side HTTP services.
