/**
 * An entity that can be sent or received with an HTTP message.
 * <p>
 * There are three distinct types of entities in HttpCore,
 * depending on where their {@link #getContent content} originates:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>streamed</b>: The content is received from a stream, or
 *     generated on the fly. In particular, this category includes
 *     entities being received from a {@link HttpConnection connection}.
 *     {@link #isStreaming Streamed} entities are generally not
 *      {@link #isRepeatable repeatable}.
 *     </li>
 * <li><b>self-contained</b>: The content is in memory or obtained by
 *     means that are independent from a connection or other entity.
 *     Self-contained entities are generally {@link #isRepeatable repeatable}.
 *     </li>
 * <li><b>wrapping</b>: The content is obtained from another entity.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * This distinction is important for connection management with incoming
 * entities. For entities that are created by an application and only sent
 * using the HTTP components framework, the difference between streamed
 * and self-contained is of little importance. In that case, it is suggested
 * to consider non-repeatable entities as streamed, and those that are
 * repeatable (without a huge effort) as self-contained.
