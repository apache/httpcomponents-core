     * Some HTTP headers (such as the set-cookie header) have values that
     * can be decomposed into multiple elements. In order to be processed
     * by this parser, such headers must be in the following form:
     * </p>
     * <pre>
     * header  = [ element ] *( "," [ element ] )
     * element = name [ "=" [ value ] ] *( ";" [ param ] )

     * name    = token
     * value   = ( token | quoted-string )
     *
     * token         = 1*&lt;any char except "=", ",", ";", &lt;"&gt; and
     *                       white space&gt;

     * text          = any char except &lt;"&gt;
     * quoted-char   = "\" char
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Any amount of white space is allowed between any part of the
     * header, element or param and is ignored. A missing value in any
     * element or param will be stored as the empty {@link String};
     * if the "=" is also missing <var>null</var> will be stored instead.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that this parser does not apply to list-typed HTTP header fields in
     * general; it is only suitable for fields that use the syntax described
     * above. Counter-examples are "Link" (RFC 8288), "If-None-Match" (RFC 7232)
     * or "Dav" (RFC 4918).
