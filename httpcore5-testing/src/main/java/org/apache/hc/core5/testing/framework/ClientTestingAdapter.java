* <p>This adapter assists the testing of an HTTP client.  This adapter in turn uses an
* {@link ClientPOJOAdapter} to actually use the HTTP client to make the request.
* See {@link ClientPOJOAdapter} to see the format of the request and the returned
* response.  The format of the returned response is also the format of the parameter
* called responseExpectations.</p>
*
* <p>This adapter will generally call the {@link ClientPOJOAdapter} methods of the same
* name when these methods are called:</p>
*
* <pre>
*
* isRequestSupported
* modifyRequest
* execute
*
* </pre>
*
* <p>See these method's documentation in {@link ClientPOJOAdapter} for details.</p>
*
* <p>The value that this adapter adds is with the modifyResponseExpectations method.  Each
* test will specify the response that is expected.  The HttpClient5 adapter is able
* to use these unmodified expectations, but if a different HTTP client (such as Groovy's
* RESTClient which uses HttpClient) for some reason needs to modify the expectations,
* it would be done in the modifyResponseExpectations method.</p>
