/**
 * An Apache HttpComponents {@link HttpRequestInterceptor} to add the {@link HttpHeaders#VIA} HTTP
 * header to requests.
 * <p>The {@link  HttpHeaders#VIA} header is used to indicate intermediate protocols and recipients
 * between the user agent and the server (on requests) or between the origin server and the client
 * (on responses). It can be used for tracking message forwards, avoiding request loops, and
 * identifying the protocol capabilities of senders along the request/response chain. Each member of
 * the {@link HttpHeaders#VIA} header field value represents a proxy or gateway that has forwarded
 * the message.
 * <p>A proxy <b>MUST</b> send an appropriate {@link  HttpHeaders#VIA} header field, as described
 * in
 * the HTTP specification, in each message that it forwards. An HTTP-to-HTTP gateway <b>MUST</b>
 * send an appropriate {@link HttpHeaders#VIA} header field in each inbound request message and
 * <b>MAY</b> send a {@link HttpHeaders#VIA} header field in forwarded response messages.
 * <p>This interceptor ensures that the {@link  HttpHeaders#VIA} header is added to the request
 * only
 * if it has not been added previously, as per the HTTP specification. Additionally, it updates the
 * values in the {@link HttpHeaders#VIA} header correctly in case of multiple intermediate protocols
 * or recipients, by appending its own information about how the message was received to the end of
 * the header field value.
 *
 * @since 5.3
