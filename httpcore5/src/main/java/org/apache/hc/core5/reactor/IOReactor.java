/**
 * HttpCore NIO is based on the Reactor pattern as described by Doug Lea.
 * The purpose of I/O reactors is to react to I/O events and to dispatch event
 * notifications to individual I/O sessions. The main idea of I/O reactor
 * pattern is to break away from the one thread per connection model imposed
 * by the classic blocking I/O model.
 * <p>
 * The IOReactor interface represents an abstract object implementing
 * the Reactor pattern.
 * <p>
 * I/O reactors usually employ a small number of dispatch threads (often as
 * few as one) to dispatch I/O event notifications to a much greater number
 * (often as many as several thousands) of I/O sessions or connections. It is
 * generally recommended to have one dispatch thread per CPU core.
