        <title>Benefits and shortcomings of the non-blocking I/O model</title>
        <para>
        Contrary to the popular belief, the performance of NIO in terms of raw data throughput is
        significantly lower than that of blocking I/O. NIO does not necessarily fit all use cases
        and should be used only where appropriate:

        <title>I/O reactor</title>
        <para>
        HttpCore NIO is based on the Reactor pattern as described by Doug Lea. The purpose of I/O
        reactors is to react to I/O events and to dispatch event notifications to individual I/O
        sessions. The main idea of I/O reactor pattern is to break away from the one thread per
        connection model imposed by the classic blocking I/O model. The <interfacename>IOReactor
        </interfacename> interface represents an abstract object which implements the Reactor pattern.
        Internally, <interfacename>IOReactor</interfacename> implementations encapsulate
        functionality of the NIO <classname>java.nio.channels.Selector</classname>.
        </para>
        <para>
        I/O reactors usually employ a small number of dispatch threads (often as few as one) to
        dispatch I/O event notifications to a much greater number (often as many as several
        thousands) of I/O sessions or connections. It is generally recommended to have one dispatch
        thread per CPU core.

            <para>
            <interfacename>IOReactor</interfacename> implementations make use of the
            <interfacename>IOEventDispatch</interfacename> interface to notify clients of events
            pending for a particular session. All methods of the <interfacename>IOEventDispatch
            </interfacename> are executed on a dispatch thread of the I/O reactor. Therefore, it is
            important that processing that takes place in the event methods will not block the
            dispatch thread for too long, as the I/O reactor will be unable to react to other
            events.

            <para>
            The shutdown of I/O reactors is a complex process and may usually take a while to
            complete. I/O reactors will attempt to gracefully terminate all active I/O sessions and
            dispatch threads approximately within the specified grace period. If any of the I/O
            sessions fails to terminate correctly, the I/O reactor will forcibly shut down
            remaining sessions.

            <title>I/O session buffers</title>
            <para>
            Quite often I/O sessions need to maintain internal I/O buffers in order to transform
            input / output data prior to returning it to the consumer or writing it to the
            underlying channel. Memory management in HttpCore NIO is based on the fundamental
            principle that the data a consumer can read, is only as much input data as it can process
            without having to allocate more memory. That means, quite often some input data may
            remain unread in one of the internal or external session buffers. The I/O reactor can
            query the status of these session buffers, and make sure the consumer gets notified
            correctly as more data gets stored in one of the session buffers, thus allowing the
            consumer to read the remaining data once it is able to process it. I/O sessions can be
            made aware of the status of external session buffers using the <interfacename>
            SessionBufferStatus</interfacename> interface.
            </para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[

            One can close an I/O session gracefully by calling <methodname>IOSession#close()
            </methodname> allowing the session to be closed in an orderly manner or by calling
            <methodname>IOSession#shutdown()</methodname> to forcibly close the underlying channel.
            The distinction between two methods is of primary importance for those types of I/O
            sessions that involve some sort of a session termination handshake such as SSL/TLS
            connections.

            <para>
            Several older JRE implementations (primarily from IBM) include what Java API

            java.nio.channels.SelectionKey</classname> class. The problem with <classname>
            java.nio.channels.SelectionKey</classname> in such JREs is that reading or writing
            of the I/O interest set may block indefinitely if the I/O selector is in the process
            of executing a select operation. HttpCore NIO can be configured to operate in a special
            mode wherein I/O interest set operations are queued and executed by on the dispatch
            thread only when the I/O selector is not engaged in a select operation.

        <para>
        Protocol specific exceptions as well as those I/O exceptions thrown in the course of
        interaction with the session's channel are to be expected and are to be dealt with by specific
        protocol handlers. These exceptions may result in termination of an individual session but
        should not affect the I/O reactor and all other active sessions. There are situations,
        however, when the I/O reactor itself encounters an internal problem such as an I/O
        exception in the underlying NIO classes or an unhandled runtime exception. Those types of
        exceptions are usually fatal and will cause the I/O reactor to shut down automatically.
        </para>
        <para>
        There is a possibility to override this behavior and prevent I/O reactors from shutting
        down automatically in case of a runtime exception or an I/O exception in internal classes.
        This can be accomplished by providing a custom implementation of the <interfacename>
        IOReactorExceptionHandler</interfacename> interface.

        One needs to be very careful about discarding exceptions indiscriminately. It is often much
        better to let the I/O reactor shut down itself cleanly and restart it rather than leaving
        it in an inconsistent or unstable state.

            <title>I/O reactor audit log</title>
            <para>
            If an I/O reactor is unable to automatically recover from an I/O or a runtime exception
            it will enter the shutdown mode. First off, it will close all active listeners and
            cancel all pending new session requests. Then it will attempt to close all active I/O
            sessions gracefully giving them some time to flush pending output data and terminate
            cleanly. Lastly, it will forcibly shut down those I/O sessions that still remain active
            after the grace period. This is a fairly complex process, where many things can fail at
            the same time and many different exceptions can be thrown in the course of the shutdown
            process. The I/O reactor will record all exceptions thrown during the shutdown process,
            including the original one that actually caused the shutdown in the first place, in an
            audit log. One can examine the audit log and decide whether it is safe to restart the
            I/O reactor.

            Non-blocking HTTP connections are not bound to a particular thread of execution and
            therefore they need to maintain their own execution context. Each non-blocking HTTP
            connection has an <interfacename>HttpContext</interfacename> instance associated with
            it, which can be used to maintain a processing state. The <interfacename>HttpContext
            </interfacename> instance is thread-safe and can be manipulated from multiple threads.

            At any point of time one can obtain the request and response objects currently being

            However, please note that the current request and the current response may not
            necessarily represent the same message exchange! Non-blocking HTTP connections can
            operate in a full duplex mode. One can process incoming and outgoing messages
            completely independently from one another. This makes non-blocking HTTP connections
            fully pipelining capable, but at same time implies that this is the job of the protocol
            handler to match logically related request and the response messages.

            <title>Non-blocking content transfer</title>
            <para>
            The process of content transfer for non-blocking connections works completely
            differently compared to that of blocking connections, as non-blocking connections need
            to accommodate to the asynchronous nature of the NIO model. The main distinction
            between two types of connections is inability to use the usual, but inherently blocking
            <classname>java.io.InputStream</classname> and <classname>java.io.OutputStream
            </classname> classes to represent streams of inbound and outbound content. HttpCore NIO
            provides <interfacename>ContentEncoder</interfacename> and <interfacename>
            ContentDecoder</interfacename> interfaces to handle the process of asynchronous content
            transfer. Non-blocking HTTP connections will instantiate the appropriate implementation
            of a content codec based on properties of the entity enclosed with the message.
            </para>
            <para>
            Non-blocking HTTP connections will fire input events until the content entity is fully
            transferred.

            Please note, one still has to provide an HttpEntity instance when submitting an entity

            be used to initialize an <interfacename>ContentEncoder</interfacename> instance to be
            used for transferring entity content. Non-blocking HTTP connections, however, ignore
            inherently blocking <methodname>HttpEntity#getContent()</methodname> and <methodname>
            HttpEntity#writeTo()</methodname> methods of the enclosed entities.

        <title>Non-blocking HTTP content producers</title>
        <para>
        As discussed previously the process of content transfer for non-blocking connections works
        completely differently compared to that for blocking connections. For obvious reasons
        classic I/O abstraction based on inherently blocking <classname>java.io.InputStream
        </classname> and <classname>java.io.OutputStream</classname> classes is not well suited
        for asynchronous data transfer. In order to avoid inefficient and potentially blocking
        I/O operation redirection through <methodname>java.nio.channels.Channles#newChannel
        </methodname> non-blocking HTTP entities are expected to implement NIO specific extension
        interface <interfacename>HttpAsyncContentProducer</interfacename>.
        </para>
        <para>
        The <interfacename>HttpAsyncContentProducer</interfacename> interface defines several
        additional method for efficient streaming of content to a non-blocking HTTP connection:

                used to suspend output events if the entity is temporarily unable to produce more
                content. When all content is finished, the producer MUST call
                <methodname>ContentEncoder#complete()</methodname>. Failure to do so may cause
                the entity to be incorrectly delimited.

                Request handlers must be implemented in a thread-safe manner. Similarly to
                servlets, request handlers should not use instance variables unless access to those
                variables are synchronized.

                The most fundamental difference of the non-blocking request handlers compared to
                their blocking counterparts is ability to defer transmission of the HTTP response
                back to the client without blocking the I/O thread by delegating the process of
                handling the HTTP request to a worker thread or another service. The instance of
                <interfacename>HttpAsyncExchange</interfacename> passed as a parameter to the
                <methodname>HttpAsyncRequestHandler#handle</methodname> method to submit
                a response as at a later point once response content becomes available.
